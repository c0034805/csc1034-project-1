===========

This package is built as a part of the CSC1034: Portfolio-1.

Type 'python walking_panda.py' to see a panda walking with
rotating camera.

To use the arguments below, type
'python walking_panda.py \<argument(s)>'

You may use the following arguments:
   
    1) --no-rotate: If used, the camera does not rotate. 
    
    2) --reverse: If used, the camera rotates to the left instead
                  of the right.
                  (If both --no-rotate and --reverse are used,
                  the former takes precedence.)

    3) --no-walk: If used, the panda does not walk.
    
    4) --scale: If used, the panda becomes larger or smaller, depending
                on the modifier entered.
                Default scale value is 1.
    
    5) --location: If used, the panda's x and y location on the
                   environment is changed to the coordinates entered.
                   Default values are -8 and 42 respectively.
